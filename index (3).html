The scriptures say that, Parashurama appealed to the gods to atone him from his previous sins, and he received two boons, from Varuna, the God of the Oceans and Bhumidevi, the Goddess of earth. He proceeded to Kanyakumari, and threw his axe northwards, and the land that rose from the sea where the axe fell was called the land of Parashurama.
